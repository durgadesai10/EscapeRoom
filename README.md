# EscapeRoom

Hello! This is the code for a Resident-evil inspired Escape Room that I created using Unreal Engine.
The game involves intricate puzzle mechanics and complex character movement controls. The puzzle
mechanics are designed to be replicable and customizable for other games, created using C++ and UE
Blueprints. The objective of the game is to solve the problems and make it out of the rooms.

This Github repository contains the main files, but does not contain all the files to run the game.
